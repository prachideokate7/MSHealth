<h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2><p>Like most website operators, MS Health collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MS Health's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MS Health's visitors use its website. From time to time, MS Health may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>MS Health also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://mshealth.in/ blog posts. MS Health only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="PII">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Certain visitors to MS Health's websites choose to interact with MS Health in ways that require MS Health to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that MS Health gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at https://mshealth.in/ to provide a username and email address.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Security">3. Security</h2><p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
